# Welcome to the Future of Blogging

**Tired of complex blog setups?** Database configurations, CMS learning curves, hosting costs, and maintenance headaches?

**That's exactly what CommitPress delivers.**

CommitPress treats your **Git repository as your CMS**. Write in Markdown, commit your changes, and publish instantly. No database required, no admin panels to learn, no monthly fees to pay.

## The Traditional Blogging Problem

Setting up a blog traditionally means:

- Database setup and configuration
- Learning a new CMS interface
- Managing user accounts and permissions
- Paying for database hosting
- Constant security updates
- Complex backup procedures
- Vendor lock-in

## The CommitPress Solution

# CommitPress workflow

1. **Write**: Create `.mdx` files in your repository
2. **Commit**: Use Git like you normally do
3. **Deploy**: Push to your repository
4. **Publish**: Your blog is automatically updated

That's it. No database, no CMS, no complexity.

## Real Cost Comparison

Let's talk numbers:

- **Traditional blog**: $5-50/month (database + hosting + CMS)
- **CommitPress**: $0 (free static hosting on Vercel/Netlify)

Over a year, that's $60-600 saved. Over five years? $300-3000.

## But Wait, There's More

CommitPress isn't just about saving money. It's about **simplicity without sacrificing features**:

✅ **Lightning Fast**: Static generation means instant loading
✅ **SEO Optimized**: Built-in meta tags and structured data  
✅ **Version Control**: Full history of every change
✅ **Collaboration**: Use pull requests for team blogging
✅ **Backup Included**: Git is your backup system
✅ **No Downtime**: Static sites rarely go down
✅ **Full Control**: Customize everything, own your data
