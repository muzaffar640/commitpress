# I Built CommitPress Because I Was Tired of Complex Blog Systems

## The Problem

At TransilienceAI, we needed a blog for our marketing website. Simple requirement, right?

It wasn't.

Every option we looked at was complicated:

- Set up a database
- Learn a new CMS
- Manage user accounts
- Pay monthly fees
- Train our team on another system

We're a cybersecurity startup. We move fast. This felt like way too much work just to publish blog posts.

All we wanted was simple: someone writes a post, adds an image, pushes code, and it's live.

## My Realization

Then it hit me. Why do blogs need databases? We already have Git. We use it every day. It tracks changes, handles collaboration, and stores everything.

What if blog posts were just files? What if publishing was just a commit?

There were some `.mdx` solutions out there, but they weren't polished. I'd already built a good markdown renderer. And with Cursor AI rules, I could make the whole thing much easier to use.

So I built CommitPress.

## How CommitPress Works

It's straightforward:

✅ Blog posts are `.mdx` files in your repo  
✅ Writing means creating a file  
✅ Publishing means `git push`  
✅ Version control is built in  
✅ Team collaboration works through pull requests

But here's the part that makes it useful.

## AI Does the Formatting

Writing isn't the hard part. Formatting is. So I added Cursor AI rules that turn messy content into proper blog posts.

Here's what you do:

1. Create a `.mdx` file
2. Paste your content from anywhere
3. Tell Cursor AI: "Format this as a blog post" tagging `blog-content` rule
4. Get proper MDX with metadata and structure
5. Add banner Image
6. Commit and push

Done.

## How We Use It at TransilienceAI

We built our marketing blog with CommitPress. Here's what happened:

- No more database costs
- Pages load instantly
- Anyone on our team can publish
- No maintenance headaches
- SEO works automatically
- Deploys anywhere

Most importantly: we stopped wasting time on blog infrastructure and got back to building our product.

## It's Not Just for Developers

I made this for our dev team, but it works for everyone:

- Startups that need a professional site without complexity
- Consultants who want to share their expertise
- Freelancers who need portfolio plus blog
- Content creators who want to own their platform
- Anyone who prefers simple over complicated

## What You Actually Get

CommitPress is a complete system:

- Clean portfolio pages
- Database-free blog
- AI formatting
- Works on mobile
- Fast loading
- SEO ready

No database. No CMS. No monthly fees.

## Why I'm Open Sourcing It

Because this should exist. Every team should have access to simple tools.

You get:

- All the source code
- AI rules for Cursor
- Setup guides
- Documentation
- Real examples from our TransilienceAI site

## The Technical Stuff

For developers who want details:

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- MDX for rich content
- TypeScript throughout
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- Cursor AI rules for formatting
- Static generation for speed

## Try It

Want to see how it works?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muzaffar640/commitpress.git
cd commitpress
npm install
npm run dev
```

To add your first post:

1. Create a `.mdx` file in `src/app/content/`
2. Paste some content and ask Cursor to format it
3. Commit and push
4. It's live

## What I Think

Simple tools win. Complex tools create problems.

CommitPress isn't trying to do everything. It does one thing well: turns Git into a publishing platform.

And honestly? That's enough.

## Get Started

- Code: [github.com/muzaffar640/commitpress](https://github.com/muzaffar640/commitpress)
- Demo: [CommitPress](https://commitpress.muzaffarhossain.com)
- Issues: Open one if something breaks

## What Will You Build?

Maybe you're a startup founder. Maybe you're a consultant. Maybe you just want a simple blog.

CommitPress works for all of that.

The question isn't whether you need a blog. It's whether you need all the complexity that usually comes with it.

**P.S.** I wrote this post in plain text, let AI format it, and published it with `git push`. The system works.
