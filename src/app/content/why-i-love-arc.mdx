# Why I Can't Stop Talking About Arc Browser: A Developer's Story

## The Backstory

Last week, I was brainstorming with Garima, our lead designer at [Transilience AI](https://www.transilience.ai/). While walking her through some UI components, she noticed my unconventional browser setup. "What do you think about Arc Browser?" she asked, pointing at my neatly organized workspace. She knew about Arc from our team meetings but hadn't given it a try, even though I'd been using it for months.

As a startup, we keep experimenting with new tech. If we like it, awesome; if we don't, we move on. What followed was a passionate 10-minute monologue about Arc browser that had her completely hooked. This wasn't the first time â€“ I'd had similar conversations when explaining Arc to friends. That's when I realized I should probably write this down. If my friends and colleagues found these insights valuable, perhaps others would too.

## This Isn't Your Typical Tutorial

Before we dive in, let me be clear: this isn't another "How to Get Started with Arc" guide with flashy images and videos. There are already excellent resources out there for that:

- [Arc's Official Guide](https://arc.net/blog)
- The Browser Company's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBrowserCompany/videos)
- [Embracing Efficiency with the Arc Browser â€” Part I](https://medium.com/insiderengineering/embracing-efficiency-with-the-arc-browser-part-i-9783def7beb3)
- [Embracing Efficiency with the Arc Browser â€” Part II](https://medium.com/insiderengineering/embracing-efficiency-with-the-arc-browser-part-ii-531b4f40601b)
- [Arc Changed the Way I Use a Mac: The Ultimate Guide to an Ingenious New Browser](https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/86505-arc-changed-the-way-i-use-a-mac-the-ultimate-guide-to-an-ingenious-new-browser/)

Instead, I want to share why Arc has become an indispensable part of my daily workflow, both as a Software Engineer and as someone obsessed with productivity.

## The Friction in My Browser Workflow

As a Mac M3 user, I've never faced Chrome's notorious memory issues. Over the years, I've experimented with Firefox, Edge, Tor, and Brave for different use cases, but I always found myself gravitating back to Chrome. Don't get me wrong - Chrome is an excellent browser that runs like a bull, especially on Apple silicon.

While Chrome reliably gets the job done, it felt more like a tool I tolerated than one I loved. Enter Arc: a browser that reimagines what working online can feel like. It didnâ€™t just meet my needs, it surprised me by solving problems I hadnâ€™t even noticed before.

Then Arc came along and showed me what I'd been missing. It solved problems I didn't even realize were problems until I experienced a better way. It's like switching from a regular text editor to VS Code - you don't realize how much friction existed in your workflow until it's gone. And the best part? It has all the good things of Chrome and some more good stuff that makes you wonder why nobody thought of this before.

## How Arc Transformed My Workflow

### 1. Command Bar: The Developer's New Best Friend

As a developer, the command bar is like having a senior engineer's brain at your fingertips. `âŒ˜+T` isn't just for new tabs anymore â€“ it's your command center. Need that React hooks documentation you had open yesterday? It's there. Looking for that GitHub issue from last week? Just type a few characters. The time saved from not hunting through tabs adds up significantly. It feels like an extension of the `Finder` feature in `MacOS`.

But here's the real game-changer: it learns from your habits. After a few days, Arc understands your workflow better than any browser I've used. It's like having a really efficient personal assistant who knows exactly what you're looking for.

### 2. Spaces: Context-Switching Without the Mental Overhead

Remember the last time you had to switch between multiple projects? In traditional browsers, this means either:

1. Having multiple windows with dozens of tabs each
2. Constantly opening and closing tabs
3. Using bookmarks (let's be honest, who maintains those?)

Arc's Spaces changed this completely. Think of Spaces as different rooms in your browser house, each perfectly arranged for its purpose. The game-changer? You can have multiple spaces under one profile, all accessible from the same place. No more logging in and out or switching between browser profiles.

Here's how I've organized my digital life:

- Development for Office work under the `Work` profile
- My personal study and development under the `Personal` profile
- Personal regular stuff different household utility portals, shopping, etc under the `Personal` profile.
- Side project that I am working on under `Hustle`

Switching projects in Arc feels less like juggling tabs and more like stepping into a different workspace, tailored to the task at hand. Each space is its own ecosystem, waiting for you exactly as you left it â€“ no tab chaos or reorganizing necessary.

### 3. Split View & Little Arc: Your New Pair Programming Partner

Every developer knows the dance: documentation on one monitor, code on another, and Stack Overflow somewhere in between. Arc's split view is like having an extra monitor within your browser. I regularly have:

- The articles that I added to the reading list
- Documentation paired with my code sandbox
- Developing screens alongside my Figma design
- API responses next to my test cases

But here's what makes it truly powerful: these splits persist within your spaces. When I return to a project, my setup is exactly how I left it â€“ no more recreating my workspace every morning.

Since I have an ultra-wide monitor, I sometimes open four split screens.

### 4. Little Arcs: Your Digital Scratch Pad

Think of Little Arcs as disposable browsers for quick tasks. Need to check something quickly without cluttering your workspace? Little Arc. Want to test how your site looks in a fresh session? Little Arc. They're like sticky notes for your browsing â€“ use them and lose them.

The real magic happens when you're deep in development. Instead of opening a new tab and losing focus on your main work, Little Arcs lets you jump in, solve a problem, and **jump right back out without losing the context of what you were working on**.

Little Arcs keeps your main workspace pristine while you handle those essential side quests.

### 5. Mobile Sync: Take Your Workflow Anywhere

One of the biggest surprises of Arc came when I installed it on my phone. Unlike traditional browsers where mobile sync means just bookmarks and passwords, Arc takes your entire workspace on the go. Each space, with its specific arrangement of pinned tabs and organization, syncs seamlessly to your mobile device.

What makes this particularly powerful is how it maintains context. When I'm coding at my desk and need to step away, I can pick up my phone and continue reading that crucial documentation or checking those API responses right where I left off. My workspace stays separate from my personal browsing, just like on my desktop.

The other day, I had to run to meet someone in the middle of work. After reaching there, I had to wait for almost half an hour. I just opened the computer version of the Arc browser and continued reading.

The mobile experience doesn't feel like a watered-down version of the desktop app - it's thoughtfully designed to complement it. You can access all your spaces, your pinned tabs, and even your recent browsing history, making the transition between devices feel natural and productive.

### 6. Boosts: Custom JavaScript and UI for Power Users

As a developer, this feature is pure gold. Imagine having custom JavaScript snippets ready to enhance any website. I've created boosts to:

- Convert light-themed websites that I frequently visit to dark mode when they don't offer it natively. You can do this in about 30 seconds. I've already transformed EdX, LinkedIn (ðŸ‘† that bright `Banner` image ðŸ‘†), idratherbewriting.com, and several other sites I spend time on
- Use community boosts like `No YouTube Shorts Plz` that hide all shorts from YouTube - something I've wanted forever
- Add keyboard shortcuts to frequently used web apps

The real power comes when you encounter a website with a UI that doesn't match your preferences - just change it in 30 seconds. It's that simple.

## Other Features Worth Mentioning

- Built-in ad blocking that actually works
- Focus mode that helps you stay on task
- Easels for visual organization
- Command palette that feels like VS Code
- Theme customization that doesn't feel hacky
- The preview window of a website on hovering over the link.

## More Than Just a Browser

Arc isn't just another Chrome alternative â€“ it's a reflection of how modern developers and professionals actually work. It's not about having a prettier browser; it's about having a smarter one. One that understands that your browser is your workspace, your research tool, your communication hub, and your development environment are all rolled into one.

I love what [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/) is doing with Arc browser. I loved it when the founder said, it is not just another impressive startup that gonna bought by other big company.

Want to give it a try? Start with the resources I mentioned above, but don't just follow tutorials. Experiment. Find your own workflow. Because that's what Arc does best â€“ it adapts to you, not the other way around.

If you're ready to boost your productivity, give [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/gift/5cfe4eba) a try.

Happy Building,
